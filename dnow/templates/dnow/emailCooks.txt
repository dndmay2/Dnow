Dear {{ cook.firstName }},
We can't thank you enough for cooking for DNOW this year! The DNOW weekend is January 12-14, 2018.
You DO NOT need to provide plates, cups or cutlery, these will be provided by the church,
and will already be at the host home. Also, you do not need to provide drinks as this
will be handled by the students and the host home. Below you will find a head count and
the allergies identified at your host home. Please coordinate the drop off time with the
host home.

Here is what you are scheduled for:

{% for meal in cook.meal_set.all %}
Meal: {{ meal.time }}
{% endfor %}
{{ hostHomeHtml|safe }}
