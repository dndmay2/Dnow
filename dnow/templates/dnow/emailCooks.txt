Dear {{ cook.firstName }},
We have had a few homes that have had changes in numbers and additional allergies.  Please look over your list again for any changes.
Also, we have had several inquiries as to what to provide for “snack” on Friday night (if that is your role).
This is totally up to you but it should probably be something substantial.  The kids always arrive to their
host home hungry.  Some examples would be a a chicken nugget tray, you could have pizzas delivered, items
(already cooked) such as pizza pockets, mozzarella sticks, etc…

We thank you again!  These kids being fed well is a big piece of the weekend and we could not do this without you!

Here is what you are scheduled for:

{% for meal in cook.meal_set.all %}
Meal: {{ meal.time }}
{% endfor %}
